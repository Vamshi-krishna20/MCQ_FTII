    hint:"Barthes said the birth of the reader must come at the cost of the death of the Author.",
    rationale:"Barthes argued that the Author as a controlling origin of meaning is a modern ideology that limits interpretation. Once a text is written, the author's intentions become irrelevant — meaning is produced through the act of reading. This had major implications for film studies, reducing the primacy of the auteur and foregrounding the spectator.",
    distractorExplorations:{"That biography is essential context for literary interpretation":"This is the traditional author-centred approach that Barthes explicitly opposes.","That only the text's historical context determines meaning":"This resembles New Historicism (Greenblatt); Barthes' essay is about liberating the reader from any singular determining context.","That authors should be held legally responsible for their work's reception":"A legal/ethical argument entirely outside Barthes' theoretical concern."}

    distractorExplorations:{"A story told without any character development — e.g., Koyaanisqatsi (1982)":"Koyaanisqatsi is a non-narrative film; absence of character development is distinct from non-linearity.","A story told simultaneously from two characters' perspectives — e.g., Rashomon (1950)":"Rashomon uses parallel/contradictory perspectives, which creates a different kind of structural complexity than pure non-linearity.","A story that changes genre midway — e.g., Psycho (1960)":"Psycho's genre subversion (killing the apparent protagonist at the midpoint) is a separate narrative strategy from non-linearity."}
